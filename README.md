# Educa
Simple learning management system (LMS) built via the Flask Framework.

Educa gives teachers the ability to create courses which allows them to keep track of grades & assignments for their students as well as keep an open communication channel with them using the inbox feature.

# Student
When logging in as a student, there will be a tab to access the dashboard. Clicking this tab gives access to the profile, courses, deadlines and inbox features for the student account. When accessing the profile page, a student can update their email, biography and as well as their profile picture. The profile page also shows a list of assignments that the student has completed as well as the courses that they are in. The courses tab is the most important feature since it keeps track of all of the courses that a student is in. In order to join a course a passcode as well as the course id or CRN(Course Registration Number) will be needed, these will be emailed to them by their teacher or given to them in a physical or online lecture. Once the course has been added, a student will have access to the syllabus, assignments, their grades and a list of students that are also in the course. Going over the deadline tab gives the student access to a list of assignments that have yet to be completed for all of their courses. Lastly, the inbox feature allows students to start a conversation with either another student in their course or the teacher for said course, it is also possible to create a group chat with multiple people, which can help in order to create study sessions.
